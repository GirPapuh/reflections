When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when collaborating with other people, and for security as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because we only have certain updates from the remote, or maybe don't want yet update our repository.

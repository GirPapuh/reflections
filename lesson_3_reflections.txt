When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when collaborating with other people, and for security as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because we only have certain updates from the remote, or maybe don't want yet update our repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

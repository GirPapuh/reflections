When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when collaborating with other people, and for security as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because we only have certain updates from the remote, or maybe don't want yet update our repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks                         
Make a copy of another person github repository into your account.

clones

make a copy of a repository into your machine, can be made from another local repository or from github.

branches
Makes a separate history of commits whit his own name.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Can cantinue working  whitout connection and then you can combine both versions, the local and the remote. 
  
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?


Sharing the modified files and making annotations on those to  explain the changes.

Definetely would be easier too collaborate using GitHub, but only if all people knows how it works.

Sharing files whiout GitHub is harder becasuse files are not always avaible.
